### Jumbled Code Round - Image Classification Challenge

Welcome to the Jumbled Code Round of our event! In this round, participants will be working on unjumbling Python code snippets to train an image classification model using a provided dataset. Follow the steps below to participate:

### Prerequisites
*GitHub account and kaggle account:*

### steps to be followed - 

1. Find the link to the dataset file in the repository. Click on it to open the dataset on Kaggle.

2. Once on Kaggle, click the "New Notebook" button at the top right to create a new notebook.

3. Navigate back to the GitHub repository and locate the seven jumbled .py code files provided.

4. Order the Code: Open each .py file and rearrange the jumbled parts of code in the correct order. The correct order will help in training an image classification model.

5. Copy each .py file content at once and paste it in the Kaggle notebook cells in the correct order.

6. Run Cells: Run each cell one by one in the Kaggle notebook to execute the code sequentially.

7. Model Training: As you run the cells, you will observe the image classification model being trained. Ensure that the final cell displays the model's performance metrics.

8. Submission: Once you successfully unjumble and run the code, submit the link to your Kaggle notebook in the provided submission form.
